The cure of dimensionality is already pretty clear here. The issue is that we have many (dummy) categorical variables that result in columns with many zeroes and few ones. This means that for some folds, there is a risk of ending up with columns that almost exclusively contain 0's for prediction, which might cause weird results. Looking at this, a model with less predictors might make sense again. This is where we conclude for now. It's up to you now to explore other model options!
